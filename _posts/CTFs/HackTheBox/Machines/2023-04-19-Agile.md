# Agile - Machine [Medium]

Hello there. Today, we are going to look at the Agile room. This was my first medium and I took a lot of time on the foothold for some unknown reason :).

## Port Enumeration

We first launch a Nmap on the machine and as we can see we have a redirection to [http://superpass.htb](http://superpass.htb). So we add it to our ```/etc/hosts``` file. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233036782-664de8cc-3677-4915-b6bf-7d644fb27a63.png)

## Web Enumeration

When accessing the website for the first time we notice nothing stange. It's just a basic website.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233037256-099039a1-8b25-40a0-8b9b-c4733072ec91.png)

We try to create an account to see what happen and we then can log in with our newly created user. When doing some action on the website as register, login, export... We may encounter server errors like the following:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233037680-b2c607fb-553f-450d-9969-d72559768a3f.png)

This allows us to know that this run a Flask app in ```wsgi_app```:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233037952-340d5c64-b91b-4e8a-8819-75990a0963b6.png)

We notice that there are two main paths. The first one is the Flask path and the other one is the app folder:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233038395-78068a2e-241e-4b87-aba6-cedd8d95f261.png)

This will come in handy later.

When we connect to the website, we see that it's basically just a password vault. We can add a user and a website and the password will be automatically generated:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233039432-8586dbe8-b0b7-49cd-b0bb-0faa03c5363a.png)

When we try to export it, a ```.csv``` file is generated. We try to intercept the command in BurpSuite and... We can see that a request is made at ```/download?fn=a_export_bec55b6381.csv``` to download a ```.csv``` file of the format ```USER_export_RANDOMCHAR.csv```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233040151-1aeb9ce0-47fe-49e1-b035-0cc23d2957dc.png)

Another request is then made to the download page stating that the debugger is up:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233041048-a8b2a94b-184c-472a-abfa-7483e45f6789.png)

## LFI

We may want to try some basic LFI and access the ```/etc/passwd``` file:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233041468-27bf845d-effc-4508-be8e-2ede8cd87dbe.png)

And voilà, we can download any file we want on the machine:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233041559-434b1b41-1c14-4807-9c7d-b5f4d196dfaa.png)

Now that we can donwload any file we want, why not downloading the ones from the website to see if we can find any interesting informations. We saw earlier that there were a file that may contain valuable informations in ```/app/app/superpass/app.py``` and we find a debug function:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233043980-1232d699-1f57-4f8b-a0e9-aff3f6d58b32.png)

## PIN Generator

Looking for ```Flask debuger vulnerabilities``` on internet we find a usefull link from [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/werkzeug) taling about a console that may allows us to get a RCE, but unfortunately, it is not available at ```/console```. But if we are carefull enought, we can see that there is a small console icon when we are on an error page:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233046011-cdf4bbb9-49c1-4f28-95f4-eebf3ddb37f1.png)

We can click on it but it will ask us for the PIN, that we don't have...Yet. 
So basically we need to retrieve all this information:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233046322-b34c7a57-399a-4a8d-b8f9-9ede2fdad4da.png)

The HackTrick article state that we need to find the user running the app, the value returned by ```getattr(app, '__name__', getattr (app .__ class__, '__name__'))``` and the one returned by ```getattr(mod, '__file__', None)``` that is the absolute path of app.py.

We already found the app name ```wsgi_app``` and the the path of the app.py is ```/app/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/flask/app.py```. So now we need to find the user running the app.

We find the website [Bangrewell](https://www.bengrewell.com/cracking-flask-werkzeug-console-pin/) that gives us much more information about how the PIN is generated and how to generate it (which is what we want to do :) ).

The article states that we can find the user running the app in the ```/proc/self/environ``` file. And after donwloading it, we find the user ```www-data```:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233048722-dcc4e552-f3a5-4a04-869e-7d15c89a520a.png)

We can be sure that it is the right user when donwloading the ```/proc/self/status``` file and see the ```UID``` of that user:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233048939-c56ba876-3a56-4472-9710-43d9206d1f2f.png)

Now we just need to find the ```private_bits``` part. We've seent that the first value is generated with the ```str(uuid.getnode())``` function. This is the MAC address of the machine that is converted as an integer. I first tried with the MAC address in the ```/proc/net/arp``` but it didn't worked. I then tried with the one of the ```eth0``` interface available in the ```/sys/class/net/eth0/address``` file. We then convert it as an INT with python:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233050395-a4fa9e86-9d13-44ab-a051-be64bfc25418.png)

We now need to recover the second value of the ```private_bits```. Following the [Bengrewell](https://www.bengrewell.com/cracking-flask-werkzeug-console-pin/) steps, we donwload the ```/etc/machine-id``` file and the ```/proc/self/cgroup``` and we recover the machine id and the cgroup value ```superpass.service```.

> /!\ WARNING /!\ The machine id may change! So be sure to recover the new one when you restart your machine. 
{: .prompt-danger}

We can now run our exploit and recover the PIN:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233052192-fa4b5c88-b90a-46e0-a635-5740271518d4.png)

> The exploit code is available here if you want but I advise you to create it from scratch with the help of the HackTrick and Bengrewell blog in addition with the source code that you downloaded.
{: .prompt-info}

## RCE

Now that we have access to the console, we may want to run command in it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233053433-46741d17-cd2c-4742-a421-eaacb33771e6.png)

We try to recover a reverse shell. I used pearl:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233053839-b39904f2-c296-484f-85b1-12cc5ccbbf08.png)

> You can stabilise your shell with the command ```python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")';export TERM=xterm``` (here we have python3 not python2). Then press ```CTRL+Z``` and type ```stty raw -echo; fg```. If nothing is printed out press ```ENTER``` and you will get a full shell with autocompletion.
{: .prompt-tip}

## Horizontal PrivEsc

If you remember, we downloaded the file ```/proc/self/environ``` and we found the user with it. But in this file, there where also a configuration file:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233055002-87eee3b9-9ebc-4bc7-9b5b-2b5a0127298a.png)

We can see that there is a SQL username and password to the ```superpass``` database:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233055163-840709f1-b1e9-4a55-8c06-7be036b4f064.png)

We can now connect to it and see that there is a password table:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233055543-d6d83e49-b21d-43ba-96fb-077bfb6f65f5.png)

We can recover the ```corum``` password for the machine (Agile) and connect via SSH to have a real shell:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233055812-de1c22c3-e862-4121-b1ec-966f6550656f.png)

We recover the flag:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233056104-735d5faa-42f8-465c-a9e4-2be383917990.png)

We can't run anything via ```sudo```, after looking around, I launched Linpeas and we find an interseting process:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233056347-257518a7-d7a6-4ac3-9aea-3513ddb438d7.png)

As we can see, it runs on a local port:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233056646-222a818f-5b8c-4002-9036-6a258e8618b7.png)

So we upload chisel on the machine to be able to look at it on our machine:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233058415-8c33588d-4b9e-4a1e-b00f-27d9a2f8f56d.png)

Now, because it's a chrome headless browser, we need to open chrome and configure the ```Discover network targets``` to be able to get the website on the forwarded port (here 41829):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233058754-91b68dcf-9e19-4e7f-ac45-54647554f55e.png)

Now add the following line and click on "Done":

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233059064-145222fb-9516-4f33-85a3-06993f13f949.png)

You now need to add the ```test.superpass.htb``` to your ```/etc/hosts``` and put as its IP ```localhost```. This ccould be found from the hosts file on the server or reading the linpeas report.

You should see the following appearing. Click on inspect to get a visual on the webpage:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233059761-aa509060-1465-4b25-a13b-514971a7f05a.png)

Now go to the vault option, and you should see the password for the ```edwards``` user:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233060440-8f91b453-287e-468a-8660-41fd0c1cf9b3.png)

## Vertical PrivEsc

As ```edwards``` we are allowed to run the sudoedit command on two files as the user ```dev_admin```:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233060583-f8d1652c-696a-4da5-9c67-51f64374f1cc.png)

When looking at what the user ```dev_admin``` has access to, we fin the following:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233128517-b78d2f34-4151-4a6f-8685-13b1cd4ed9de.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233128440-6f43f3a8-9bad-4ab7-9405-3463850a5cd3.png)

So we can see that there is a binary on the virtual environment called ```activate```. Looking at all process either with the Linpeas dump but preferably with PsPy, we can see that it is executed by the root:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233132233-c9dbd52f-2aee-4579-a2bd-13c4c6c76695.png)

We find a recent CVE on sudoedit that would allow us to write in a file as ```dev_admin```. We find a [blog](https://medium.com/@dev.nest/how-to-bypass-sudo-exploit-cve-2023-22809-vulnerability-296ef10a1466) explaining how to exploit this CVE-2023-22809. 

First of all, we need to verify that we can write in this script ```/app/venv/bin/activate``` and... We do:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233132988-c3c237ed-57a8-402a-b1ed-09650e2efdb6.png)

So we use the following command to write in the ```activate``` file and put in it our reverse shell:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233133503-7d539b4f-497c-4a4e-9953-f1019bcb3367.png)

> Note that you can use any editor you want. Nano also worked perfectly.
{: .prompt-tip}

We then put at the beggining our reverse shell:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73934639/233133750-fff471eb-732c-4d11-b140-0eb5422dbdba.png)

We need to quit the vi editor two times (```:wq```) and... Voilà !!!:
